# GLIF3
In this repo, we created 3 glif models using PyTorch

The traditional glif3 model, using 1st order Euler forward method. The time of spike is calculated within each time bin acurately. The evolution in each time bin is based on the actual spike-window-free time during each time bin.

Similarly, we added the nonlinear version glif3 and the nonlinear version glif5 model.
